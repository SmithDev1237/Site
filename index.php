	  				<h1>Welcome to my online portfolio</h1>
	    			<p>I am a web / software developer based in the UK, I am currently working for Hillarys as a junior developer working on several of their websites.  My main roles here are support and maintenance on their current sites and also to redevelop them onto the umbraco CMS platform, for which I recently got certified to level 2 when I completed their training courses.</p>
					<p>The main technologies I am currently working with are ASP.net (C#), MsSql, HTML5 and CSS3.  I am also using frameworks such as JQuery and Moderniser to help speed up development and insure backwards compatibility with older browsers.</p>
					<p> Before working at Hillarys I was at Derby University studying  Internet Computing BSc(Hons).  For my 3rd year I did a 13 month  work placement at CWI technical, a web development and monitoring systems company.</p>
	    			<p>I have previous experience working with PHP, JavaScript (especially AJAX), HTML, CSS, XML and SQL databases. All in an object orientated environment.   I am also familiar with Dreamweaver, NetBeans, Fireworks and other development software used in the process of developing websites.</p>
	    			<p>For my final year research paper I investigated if HTML5 can be used for the development of  Multiplayer Online Games (MOG).  This involved doing literature reviews and then developing a fully working MOG from the information gained.</p>
